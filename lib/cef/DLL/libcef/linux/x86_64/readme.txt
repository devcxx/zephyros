NOTE: The Linux version currently doesn't work with CEF 3.2883 because of a newly introduced
dependency on GTK-2 in libcef.so.
Please use CEF 3.2623 and the branch develop-cef2613 for now.

Download "CEF 3.2883.*" from http://opensource.spotify.com/cefbuilds/index.html (Linux 64-bit),
extract, and copy the folders "Debug", "Release", "Resources" into this folder.
