NOTE: The Linux version currently doesn't work with CEF 3.2883 because of a newly introduced
dependency on GTK-2 in libcef.so.
Please use CEF 3.2623 and the branch develop-cef2613 for now.

Download the binary Standard Distribution of CEF from
    http://opensource.spotify.com/cefbuilds/cef_binary_3.2883.1545.gd685d27_linux64.tar.bz2
Extract the archive and copy the folders "Debug", "Release", "Resources" into this folder.
