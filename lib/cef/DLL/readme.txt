The "Win32" and "x64" subfolders in the folder "libcef" each contain the following subfolders
of the Windows 32bit and Windows 64bit builds, respectively, of the CEF project
(https://cefbuilds.com/, currently branch 2454):

- Debug
- Release
- Resources

These folders aren't contained in this git project, please download the binary CEF distributions
from https://cefbuilds.com/ (at least the one for the architecture you want to build for)
and copy them into the subfolders.
